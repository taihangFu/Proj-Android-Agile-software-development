# PudgetPlanner


This Android app is called PudgetPlanner, it is a cloud based Budget App that provide budget calculators for saving goal and allowed user to create multiple budget accounts
in different catalog. 

Since this is cloud sdk based, users would register and log in to their own user account and inviting other users to
join your budget account is also allowed(so that you might invite your friends or family member to some specific budget account such as
home rent budget account since multiple people might shared a single home rent, and each user can contribute to the same budget account thru internet).

So to simplify, we have 2 main kind of account:
1. user account for every single user
2. each user account has 0 or more budget account in different catalogs such as home rent account, electricity budget account, self cutomised account...
and each budget account could have 1 or more users(by invting others to your accoutn thru Push Notification) so that each can motify and contribute to a single budget account.

We used Parse cloud sdk as our backend service(database)
https://www.parse.com/

some of the interface can be improved, part of rotate screens (horizontal) has not finished.

This is a Agile software development project for a 5 people group, me and another guys are on charge on backend and we mostly
in pair programming, others 3 members handled front end and interface. We used Pivotal Tracker to Track our progress.
